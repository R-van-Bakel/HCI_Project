# HCI_Project
The project for Human Computer Interaction. A single page application that helps mothers stay smoke-free after the pregnancy.

!IMPORTANT
This application relies on ajax (through jQuery) and will therefore only properly function when being run from a server.
We used the live-server functionality from nodejs to run a local server to test the application on.
