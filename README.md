# HCI_Project
The project for Human Computer Interaction. A single page application that helps mothers from relapsing into smoking after the pregnancy.

!IMPORTANT
This application relies on ajex (through jQuery) and will therefore only propperly function when being run from a server.
We used the live-server functionality from nodejs to run a local server to test the application on.
